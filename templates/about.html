                <h2>What is FipHelper?</h2>
                    <p>
                        "Flipping" items is blah blah blah... Buy low sell high... Introductory stuff.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The problem is that it takes time and experience to start flipping items effectively. It can
                        also be difficult to get started and take full advantage of garage sale offerings without
                        knowledge of a wide range of product categories. FlipHelper is your yard sale advisor, bringing
                        you the latest product values from the top online resale marketplaces and letting you know
                        whether or not someone's trash can be turned into your treasure.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That was a cheezy line.
                    </p>
                <br>
                <h2>How it Works</h2>
                    <p>
                        Enter the name or description of an item you find at a yard sale/thrift store/laying around the
                        house (the more descriptive, the better!). Also enter the asking price, or what you think it's
                        worth if you already own it. If applicable, select a category that the item falls into. This
                        serves to exclude irrelevant results that may match your search terms and to include some
                        niche, category-specific marketplaces.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Hit search, and FlipHelper finds the most recent online listings that match your search terms,
                        across a number of sites such as eBay, Etsy, and Reverb. Based on the most recent sold and
                        active listings, FlipHelper lets you know if what you're looking at has potential to be
                        flipped for profit.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        FlipHelper's insights into market pricing take the guesswork out of yard sale flipping, and
                        provide you with immediate intuition and insider knowledge about any item you find.
